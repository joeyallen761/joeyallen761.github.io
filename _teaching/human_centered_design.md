I assisted Professor Caitlin Kelleher conduct this undergraduate course which introduces students to human-centered design through projects and in-class discussion. Topics include Information Foraging Theory, Iterative Design, Supporting Problemsolving Strategies, and Cognitive Load Theory. Students conducted user tests with web interfaces, and used their findings to iteratively evolve these interfaces. My duties included helping students with generic questions, holding office hours, and leading the section and project on Cognitive Load Theory.
