In summers of 2013-2015, I taught several week-long classes in Mercer University's Creative Computer Camps. First, I taught introductory programming to grades 2-12 through the visualization softwares “Greenfoot”, “Scratch”, and “Alice”. I also instructed groups of 2nd-5th or 6th-12th graders in programming of LEGO’s Ev3 robot. Finally, I taught a course showing high school students the fundamentals of video game creation and design through programs like “Scratch” and “Kodu.”
