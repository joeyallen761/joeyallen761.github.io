This is a project made to help people explore cities and tastes through data.

<div class="iframe-with-caption">

  <em>Top-rated restaurants registered on Google Maps in the St. Louis area with advanced filtering. There is already a strong filter applied so as not to overwhelm your browser with data.</em>

It may not seem like a terribly ambitious venture to download a list of all the restaurants in an area. I initially thought this would be a two-hour project because I believed it would be trivial to download restaurant data from Google Maps. After all..


This is a project that employs a medley of huggingface models, speech-to-text, time-series analysis, visualization, and LLM prompt engineering to provide feedback to a basketball player as they practice their shot.
